# Fashion Item Classification using Transfer Learning
## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to classify fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using transfer learning techniques. The dataset consists of grayscale images classified into 10 categories:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

## Dataset Description

The Fashion-MNIST dataset includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels and grayscale. For the purposes of this project, the images were converted to three channels (RGB) and resized to 32x32 pixels to meet the input requirements of the pre-trained models.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the fine-tuned models was assessed using the following evaluation metrics:
- **Loss**: Categorical cross-entropy loss was used as the loss function.
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **F1 Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.

## Findings and Discussion

| Model       | Accuracy | Loss   | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| VGG16       | 0.8812   | 0.2755 | 0.2455    | 0.1123 | 0.2340   |
| ResNet50    | 0.7673   | 0.4555 | 0.2785    | 0.2655 | 0.5324   |
| InceptionV3 | 0.9950   | 0.0404 | 0.2325    | 0.2965 | 0.3244   |

### Model Analysis
- **VGG16**: Achieved an accuracy of 88.12%, showing good performance in classifying fashion items. Its simple architecture and decent performance make it a suitable choice for this task.
- **ResNet50**: Achieved an accuracy of 76.73%, indicating acceptable performance. Its deeper architecture allows it to capture complex features, which can be beneficial in analyzing fashion images.
- **InceptionV3**: Achieved the highest accuracy of 99.50%, showing excellent performance. Its ability to capture fine details makes it suitable for tasks requiring detailed analysis.

### Strengths of Transfer Learning
- **Efficiency**: Transfer learning allows leveraging pre-trained models' weights, reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data and training time.
- **Performance**: It enables the use of state-of-the-art architectures and techniques, which can improve performance.

### Limitations of Transfer Learning
- **Generalization**: Pre-trained models may not always generalize well to new domains, requiring fine-tuning and adaptation.
- **Dependence on Model Choice**: The choice of pre-trained model and the extent of fine-tuning can significantly impact performance.
